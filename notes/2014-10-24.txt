Created functions for feedforward neural language model and scripts for splitting data for training, validating, and testing purpose.

Created another preprocessing script that divide each sentence each line, so that the text can be fed in SRILM for ngram language modelling.

Used SRILM to model the enwik8 corpus. Used default trigram with GT discouting and Katz backoff.
