Finished discount rarely seen items script. Re-index new corpus and produce new dict.

Start working on cost function.

Derived error derivatives.

Thinking instead of passing the target vector in one-hot encoding, we can simply pass the target in terms of the class index. And we can also pass input in terms of class index. Although losing a little generality, (a classifier has to have some class in the output but the input is not necessarily one-hot), but this is computationally cheaper because otherwise we will end up multiplying 54K zeros.

Thinking whether we should pretrain the encoding layer. Need to read some paper related to pretraining and compare the performance of with pretrain and without pretrain.
